   <h1>i'm giving it a 7.5 ☁️</h1>

   <p>the internet, this amazing tool that allows people from all over the world to connect with one another, is a high 7.5 in my book! </p>

   <p>with everything for everyone, the internet is like an online costco — you’re bound to find something for you. it’s super helpful when it comes to school work and research,with  all the answers to your questions just a few clicks away! however, i will say that for it to be as fast as just “a few clicks,” you’ll need to be somewhere with generally fast wifi.</p>
    
   <p>there’s also tons of social media apps you can access through the internet, all fun for just passing your time. instagram and pinterest, for example, can be fun resources to scroll through for inspiration! tiktok is also really good for those with short attention spans, you can watch entertaining or informative videos that are condensed into 45 seconds! the one downside to social media that i would have to say is the toll it may take on your mental health, so be sure to take some breaks. </p>
    
    <p>overall, i’d say it’s 3/5 stars, it’s not too terrible of a place!
