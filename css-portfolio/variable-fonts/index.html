    ♡ eevee's been one of my favorite pokemon for a fat minute now, but the more they started adding it into the pokemon anime, i found myself loving it even more! i didn't know that was possible, but it's so cute, so fun to draw, and an all-around great pokemon to have on a team.</p>
    <p>
        ♡ another really cool thing about eevee is with the fact that it has the option to evolve into one out of eight different other pokemon, you're bound to have at least one that matches your specific fighting style/strategy. i love this so much because it makes it's evolutions so good in competitive battles, it's definitely worth the hassle of finding a good one and training it :,)</p>
