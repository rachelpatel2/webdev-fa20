    <p>this game takes place in classical japan, it doesn't ever specify the exact years, but it's pretty obvious from seeing the scenes that it was long ago. this game combines japanese shinto mythology + folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the sun goddess, named amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf! it's super pretty and the graphics are like traditional paintings, which make it stand out. i got into the game after coming across tons of fanart for it in 2011, and i'm so glad i did!</p>
