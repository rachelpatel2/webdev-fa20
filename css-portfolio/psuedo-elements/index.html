    <p>, it doesn't ever specify the exact years, but it's pretty obvious from seeing the scenes that it was long ago. this game combines japanese shinto mythology + folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the sun goddess, named amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf! it's super pretty and the graphics are like traditional paintings, which make it stand out.</p>
